**a.**  
x1 = 610 + x4 - 450 = 160 + x4  
x2 = 400 + x1 - 640 = x1 - 240  
x3 = 600 + x2  
x4 = x3 - 520  
matrix prep:  
x1           - x4 = 160  
x1 - x2           = 240  
   - x2 + x3      = 600  
          x3 - x4 = 520  
**b.**
```{r}
T = cbind(c(1, 1, 0, 0),
          c(0, -1, -1, 0),
          c(0, 0, 1, 1),
          c(-1, 0, 0, -1),
          c(160, 240, 600, 520))

x1 = 160 + x4  
x2 = x4 - 80  
x3 = 520 + x4  
x4 = *free*  
**c.**  
when 200 cars use road x4, 360 cars will use x1, 120 cars will use x2, and 720 cars will use x3  
when 400 cars use road x4, 560 cars will use x1, 320 cars will use x2, and 920 cars will use x3  
**d.**  
Yes, but only if x4 = 80 since the general equation of x2 produces this solution. We then get x1 = 240 and x3 = 600.
